                Thai Yoga Massage is based on an ancient healing system which
                incorporates acupressure, massage, yoga, proper breath, and
                energy work. The practitioner moves the client’s body gently in
                different positions while palming and thumbing along the
                meridians and stretching the body in a slow, rhythmic and
                mindful way. It combines compressions, joint mobilizations,
                rocking, stretching, twisting, wringing, and more in order to
                re-establish full range of motion and reprogram the nervous
                system. Thai Yoga Massage helps to relieve muscular tension,
                increases circulation and flexibility. The treatment is tailored
                to the client’s specific needs.{" "}

                Thai Yoga Massage is done on the floor on a big mat with the
                recipient in loose, comfortable clothing. This allows the client
                a more complete range of motion as you won’t just be lying on
                your back or stomach when you receive a Thai massage nor will
                your masseuse, who receives an even greater advantage by being
                on the floor rather than hunched over a table.
              </p>
              <p>
                During a Thai massage, the masseuse moves all around and above
                the client to access a wider range of angles over each part of
                the body, even in cases when the client is much larger than the
                masseuse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rather than just using hands, fists, forearms and elbows the
                standard tools of western massage Thai masseuse may use legs and
                feet during the massage. Oftentimes, they will use a combination
                of both to gain leverage as they initiate deep stretches of the
                client’s arms, legs, hips, and shoulders. Oil or lotions are
                rarely used.{" "}
