We appreciate that you’ve chosen us for your massage and bodywork needs. To provide the best service possible to our clients we have implemented the following policies.
</p>
<ul className='text-light'>
<li>We require a Credit Card to book all appointments including same day appointments. If you do not show up for your scheduled appointment, your card or package on file will be charged a fee.</li>
<li>We have a 24 Hours Cancellation Policy. If you need to Change or Cancel your appointment, you must notify us at least 24 hours in advance to avoid a 50% cancellation fee applied to your credit card or package on file. Clients who do not show up or inform us may be charged in full</li>
<li>Massage therapy is for relaxation and therapeutic purposes only. There is absolutely no sexual component to massage whatsoever. Any insinuation, joke, gesture, conversation, or request otherwise will result in immediate termination of your session and a refusal of any and all services in the future. You will be charged the full service fee regardless of the length of your session. Depending on the behavior exhibited we may also file a report with the local authorities if necessary. Treat your therapist with respect and dignity and you will be treated the same in return.</li>
<li>If you are late to your session, we will do our best to accommodate you for the time you have left without penalizing the following client. Clients who are over 20 minutes late will be asked to reschedule their appointment, and will be charged a cancellation fee.</li>
<li>Pregnant Clients: Please specify that you are pregnant when booking so we may schedule with a Prenatal Certified Therapist. If you are scheduling an appointment for your partner or a friend who is expecting, you must notify us upon booking the reservation.</li>
